        "Description": "After seeing the success of his nephew, Kamal Tamang, who use to drive trucks decided to start Interlocking brick business in Pharphing, a town close to Kathmandu. He is really happy that he doesn’t have to be away from his family and struggle to earn and make ends meet. His CSEB business has allowed him to stay close to the family and make good money at the same time. In the beginning (during the reconstruction) his business expanded exponentially and since has done very well. Today his wife and daughter are also helping him in the enterprise while his son drives the truck. They are soon planning to sell their truck and add another machine somewhere in Kathmandu valley. <br />\n"
